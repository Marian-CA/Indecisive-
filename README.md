# **Flip a Coin App**

## **Project Description**

The **Flip a Coin App** is a simple web application built with React to help users make quick decisions. It addresses the challenge of **indecision** and **decision fatigue**, which occurs when people become mentally exhausted from the constant need to make choices. This app provides an easy way to relieve that cognitive load by flipping a virtual coin, offering immediate results of either "heads" or "tails."

This project integrates the **Coin Flip API** from RapidAPI, demonstrating essential web development concepts such as API integration, state management using React hooks, and error handling.

---

## **How It Works**

- **Press the Flip Coin button:** This triggers the app to call the **Coin Flip API**.
- **See the result:** The app displays the outcome (heads or tails) on the screen.
- **Handles errors gracefully:** If the API request fails, a friendly error message will be shown.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **React:** Frontend library used for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For logic and API calls.
- **Coin Flip API:** External API to generate random coin flip outcomes.
